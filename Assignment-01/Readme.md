## 📌 Problems and Solutions

### Problem 1
1. **Is the set of odd numbers with the binary operation (+), i.e., ⟨O, +⟩, an abelian group?**  
✅ Answer: **False** – explained with proper group properties.

2. **Let G be a group of order pq, where p and q are distinct primes. Prove that G is abelian.**  
   ✅ Answer: **True** – with reasoning based on Sylow theorems.

3. **If G is a group of order p², where p is prime, then G is abelian if and only if it has p + 1 subgroups of order p.**  
   ✅ Answer: **True** – shown using subgroup properties.

4. **Let G be a finite group and H be a proper subgroup of G. Prove that the union of all conjugates of H cannot be equal to G.**  
   ✅ Answer: **True** – explained using group and conjugacy arguments.

5. **Let G be a group and N be a normal subgroup of G. If G/N is cyclic and N is cyclic, prove that G is abelian.**  
   ✅ Answer: **True** – shown by properties of cyclic and normal subgroups.

6. **In any group G, the set of elements of finite order forms a subgroup of G.**  
   ✅ Answer: **True** – with proof using subgroup test.

7. **Let G be a finite group and p be the smallest prime dividing |G|. Prove that any subgroup of index p in G is normal.**  
   ✅ Answer: **True** – reasoned using index and group order properties.

8. **Let G be a group and a, b ∈ G. Prove that if a⁴ = b² and ab = ba, then (ab)⁶ = e.**  
   ✅ Answer: **True** – verified using commutativity and group laws.
